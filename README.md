This is s simple console game "Rock Paper Scissors"

Rock, paper, scissors is a fun and easy hand game that anyone can learn and enjoy. It’s a great way to make minor decisions when you and a friend can’t agree on something, or even just an entertaining way to pass the time. 

Rules
Each object wins against one shape and loses to another. For instance, rock “crushes” scissors but is “covered” by paper, paper “covers” rock but is “cut” by scissors, and scissors is “crushed” by rock but “cuts” paper. The player who picks the stronger of the two objects is the winner. If both players choose the same objects, the game outcome is "draw".

In this console game the final winner is determined out of three games.
